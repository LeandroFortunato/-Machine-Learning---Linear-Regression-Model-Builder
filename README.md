# -Machine-Learning---Linear-Regression-Model-Builder

This program builds the best possible regression model for a given case, by just being provided the data source (file) and target. Among all types of linear models (simple,multiple,polynomial,multi-dimensional) it will build the best one (based on possible scores), choosing automatically the most suitable order and features for it. It also always tries to refine the model, whenever is possible, with Ridge Regression at the end.
